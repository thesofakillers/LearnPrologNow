_First, explain what the following program does:_
```prolog
class(Number,positive)  :-  Number  >  0.
class(0,zero).
class(Number,negative)  :-  Number  <  0.
```
The program outputs which class an inputted number is, out of the possible classes "positive", "zero", and "negative", depending on whether the number is, of course, positive, zero or negative, respectively.
