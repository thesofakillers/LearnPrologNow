_In the text, we discussed the predicate_
```prolog
descend(X,Y)  :-  child(X,Y).
descend(X,Y)  :-  child(X,Z),
                    descend(Z,Y).
```
_Suppose we reformulated this predicate as follows:_
```prolog
descend(X,Y)  :-  child(X,Y).
descend(X,Y)  :-  descend(X,Z),
                    descend(Z,Y).
```
_Would this be problematic?_
This _would_ be problematic because in all false cases the program would get stuck in an infinite loop where it would keep checking whether X has any descendants named Y. This is because in false cases, the base case is basically ignored, since Y is not a child of X. The definition of the rule for descend/2 would become a recursive definition without a base case.
