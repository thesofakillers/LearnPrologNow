# Learn Prolog Now!
My solutions to some of the exercises and practicals outlined in the book [Learn Prolog Now!](http://www.learnprolognow.org/) by by Patrick Blackburn, Johan Bos, and Kristina Striegnitz.

These solutions are of course those of someone who is learning the language, so should perhaps not be taken as optimal. 

Note that I did this as part of revision for a module I took at University. Parts of the module did not overlap with the book so in the interest of time (which as we all know is very precious during revision season!) I do not cover all the content of the book.
