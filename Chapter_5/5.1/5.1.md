_How does Prolog respond to the following queries?_
1. `X  =  3*4.` We get `X = 3*4.`
2. `X  is  3*4.` We get `X = 12.`
3. `4  is  X.` We get an error.
4. `X  =  Y.` We get `X = Y.`
5. `3  is  1+2.` We get `true.`
6. `3  is  +(1,2).` We get `true.`
7. `3  is  X+2.` We get an error.
8. `X  is  1+2.` We get `X = 3.`
9. `1+2  is  1+2.` We get false.
10. `is(X,+(1,2)).` We get `X = 3.`
11. `3+2  =  +(3,2).` We get true.
12. `*(7,5)  =  7*5.` We get true.
13. `*(7,+(3,2))  =  7*(3+2).` We get true.
14. `*(7,(3+2))  =  7*(3+2).` We get true.
15. `7*3+2  =  *(7,+(3,2)).` We get false.
16. `*(7,(3+2))  =  7*(+(3,2)).` We get true.
