_Suppose we have the following database:_

```prolog
  p(1).
  p(2):-  !.
  p(3).
```

_Write all of Prologâ€™s answers to the following queries:_
1. `?-  p(X).` Will give
    ```
    X = 1;
    X = 2.
    ```
2. `?-  p(X),p(Y).` Will give
    ```
    X = Y, Y = 1;
    X = Y, Y = 2;
    X = 1, Y = 2;
    X = 2, Y = 1.
    ```
3. `?-  p(X),!,p(Y).` Will give
    ```
    X = Y, Y = 1;
    X = 1, Y = 2.
    ```
