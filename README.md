# Learn Prolog Now!
My solutions to the exercises and practicals outlined in the book [Learn Prolog Now!](http://www.learnprolognow.org/) by by Patrick Blackburn, Johan Bos, and Kristina Striegnitz.

These solutions are of course those of someone who is learning the language, so should perhaps not be taken as optimal.
